# Copybara Docker Image

This project builds https://github.com/google/copybara docker image on github actions. It should be a temporal workaround for the official image being not available (see https://github.com/google/copybara/issues/82).

The built image is available at https://github.com/anipos/copybara-docker-image/packages/60275.
